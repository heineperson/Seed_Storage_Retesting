# How to create a procedure for retesting, while still gaining data for publication?

# Assumptions

+ Every quarter we can run 30 tests (120 test per year)
+ Each year we have around 20 rare seed collections

# Data Import
```{r set up}
library(data.table)

seedAcc <- fread("Data/SeedCollectionDetails_2019-Jun-04_2151.csv")
germTest <- fread("Data/Germination_2019-Jun-04_2151.csv")
```

# Make Table of Status for Each Accession
